## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Andy Bell's 'A Modern CSS Reset'](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This is a great reset that is well commented and isn't over the top.  Andy does a great job of explaining *why* we don't really need a huge reset anymore.  I find this one gets the job done 99% of the time.
